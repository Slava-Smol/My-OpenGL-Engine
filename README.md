# My-OpenGL-Engine
Written using C# and the OpenTK binding

Its not really an Engine... but you will need it for my pacman clone, in case you downloaded it.
I will just provide the code fragments of this "Engine", I won't include all of the packages I used.

So the main goal of this commit is that you get the idea of how the "Engine" is build.
